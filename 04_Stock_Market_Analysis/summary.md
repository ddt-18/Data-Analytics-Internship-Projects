# 📈 Stock Market Analysis (Dynamic via yFinance)

## 🧠 Objective
To analyze and compare the stock performance of Apple, Microsoft, Google, and Netflix over the past 3 months using real-time data pulled from Yahoo Finance via the `yfinance` Python API.

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- **Python**: yfinance, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
- **Jupyter Notebook**: for analysis, API calls, and visualizations

---

## 🔧 Key Steps
- Pulled historical stock data for Apple (`AAPL`), Microsoft (`MSFT`), Google (`GOOGL`), and Netflix (`NFLX`) using the `yfinance` API.
- Structured the data to compare `Close` prices and trading `Volume` over time.
- Created line plots to visualize stock trends over the last 3 months.
- Compared stock behaviors visually to identify volatility and performance trends.

---

## 📊 Key Insights
- 📈 Apple and Microsoft showed relatively steady growth compared to others.
- 🎢 Netflix displayed noticeable volatility with sharper price swings.
- 🔍 Google exhibited a mid-level fluctuation pattern — less volatile than Netflix but not as steady as Apple.
- 💡 Trading volume spikes were observed on specific dates for each company, likely linked to news or earnings events.

---

## 📌 Deliverables
- `Stock Market Analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing dynamic data pull, EDA, and visual comparisons.
- **No static dataset included**, as stock data is retrieved dynamically via `yfinance` on notebook execution.

---

## ✅ Learnings & Outcomes
- Strengthened skills in **API-based data access** and working with **live time-series stock data**.
- Improved understanding of basic financial indicators (closing price, volume).
- Gained confidence in analyzing and comparing multiple stocks programmatically using Python.
