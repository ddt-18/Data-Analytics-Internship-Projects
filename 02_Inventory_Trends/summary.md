# 📦 Inventory Data Analysis

## 🧠 Objective
To analyze inventory, sales, and purchasing data for a manufacturing company to identify inefficiencies, reduce costs, and improve overall inventory strategy.

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- **Python**: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
- **Jupyter Notebook**: for step-by-step analysis and visualization

---

## 🔧 Key Steps
- Cleaned and merged sales, purchase, and inventory datasets
- Calculated key metrics like:
  - Days of Inventory (DOI)
  - Stock Turnover Ratio
  - Inventory Holding Cost
- Identified top-selling products and slow-moving stock
- Conducted category-wise and supplier-wise inventory evaluation
- Used correlation plots and bar charts to uncover patterns

---

## 📊 Key Insights
- 🐌 Several products had very low turnover ratios, indicating overstock or poor demand.
- 📈 High-volume items showed consistent ordering patterns, but some were overstocked due to poor forecasting.
- 💸 Inventory holding costs were higher in certain categories, calling for inventory level optimization.
- 🛒 Purchase trends revealed an imbalance between procurement frequency and actual sales performance.

## 📌 Deliverables
- `Inventory Data Analysis.ipynb`: Full notebook with logic, metrics, and visuals
- `summary.md`: This documentation file
- `inventory_data.csv` *(or `.xlsx`)*: Dataset used for the project

---

## ✅ Learnings & Outcomes
- Strengthened understanding of inventory metrics used in real-world logistics and operations.
- Practiced identifying business inefficiencies through data cleaning and visual storytelling.
- Reinforced the importance of aligning supply with actual demand using data-driven decisions.

> 📎 This project mimics real operational challenges and highlights how data analysis can support better supply chain decisions.
